# Rotman-Datathon

This project created for the Rotman Masters of Management Analytics Datathon explores strategies to enhance global supply chain resilience by focusing on metrics beyond the Logistics Performance Index, such as the Human Capital Index, Current Health Expenditure per Capita, and External Debt Stock. It highlights the roles of businesses and policymakers in addressing supply chain challenges through strategic investments in education, healthcare, and infrastructure.
